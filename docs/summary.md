### Modeling Features Across All

- *Pros*: Microarchitecture-aware mapping, concurrency analysis, memory bottleneck detection, energy-delay modeling, thermal profiling.
- *Cons*: Some models rely on synthetic estimates; real-world calibration may vary by workload and batch size.


## Energy efficiency

**The Stillwater KPU achieves superior energy efficiency over GPUs by using a distributed dataflow architecture that minimizes control overhead, exploits fine-grained parallelism, and avoids speculative execution. It executes ML workloads with lower power by aligning computation with operand availability and precision needs.**

### Key Architectural Features Driving Energy Efficiency

- **Distributed Dataflow Execution**  
  Unlike GPUs, which rely on centralized control and SIMD-style execution, the KPU uses a *dataflow model* where operations are triggered by operand availability. This avoids wasted cycles and speculative execution, reducing dynamic power draw.

- **Precision-Adaptive Compute**  
  The KPU supports *mixed-precision arithmetic*, including posit and logfloat formats, allowing it to use just enough precision for each operation. This reduces switching activity and memory bandwidth compared to fixed-width FP32/FP16 on GPUs.

- **Streaming Operand Delivery**  
  Operand injection is *streamed and scheduled* to match the compute pipeline's needs, avoiding stalls and buffer overflows. This contrasts with GPU memory hierarchies that often overfetch or underutilize cache lines.

- **No Instruction Fetch/Decode Overhead**  
  The KPU eliminates traditional instruction fetch/decode stages by using *precompiled operand graphs*. This saves energy otherwise spent on control logic and instruction dispatch.

- **Result-Stationary Scheduling**  
  Intermediate results remain in place while operands stream through, minimizing data movement. GPUs often shuttle data between registers, shared memory, and global memory, incurring energy costs.

- **Energy-Delay Product (EDP) Optimization**  
  The KPU is designed to minimize EDP by aligning compute throughput with operand availability and memory movement. GPUs prioritize throughput, often at the expense of energy efficiency.
