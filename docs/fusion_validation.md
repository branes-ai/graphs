## Test Results

**Overall Success Rate: 100.0%**

|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Conv2d_BatchNorm2d_ReLU | Custom model | ✓ Detected | 3 ops |
| Conv2d_BatchNorm2d | ResNet-18 | ✓ 11 instances | 2 ops |
| add_ReLU | ResNet-18 | ✓ 8 instances | 2 ops |

**Result:** All known fusion patterns correctly identified ✓

### 2. Metrics Calculations ✓

Validates computational and memory metrics on ResNet-18:

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Error | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| FLOPs | 3.64 GFLOPs | 3.63 GFLOPs | 0.3% | ✓ Pass |
| Memory Reduction | >10% | 19.6% | - | ✓ Pass |
| Arithmetic Intensity | >0 | 50.57 FLOPs/byte | - | ✓ Pass |

**Result:** All metrics within tolerance ✓

### 3. Cross-validation ✓

#### 3.1 fvcore FlopCountAnalysis

| fvcore | FLOPs (MACs×2) | 3.638 GFLOPs | - | Reference |
| Ours | FLOPs | 3.628 GFLOPs | 0.3% | ✓ Pass |

**Note:** fvcore counts MACs (multiply-accumulate operations), not FLOPs. We convert MACs→FLOPs by multiplying by 2.

#### 3.2 torch.profiler

|------|-------|-------|--------|
| torch.profiler | 3.628 GFLOPs | - | Reference |
| Ours | 3.628 GFLOPs | 0.0% | ✓ Perfect Match |

**Result:** Perfect agreement with torch.profiler ✓

### 4. Fusion Quality ✓

Tests fusion efficiency across multiple architectures:

| Model | Fusion Efficiency | Data Movement Reduction | Status |
|-------|------------------|------------------------|--------|
| ResNet-18 | 2.16× | 19.6% | ✓ Good |
| MobileNet-V2 | 2.32× | 42.0% | ✓ Good |

**Result:** All models show effective fusion (>1.5× efficiency) ✓

### 5. Balance Analysis ✓

Validates all sections of the balance analysis report:

| Section | Present | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Fusion Size Distribution | ✓ | Pass |
| Fusion Quality Analysis | ✓ | Pass |
| Top Fusion Patterns | ✓ | Pass |
| Bottleneck Distribution | ✓ | Pass |
| Missed Fusion Opportunities | ✓ | Pass |
| Fusion Strategy Comparison | ✓ | Pass |
| Recommendations | ✓ | Pass |

**Additional Checks:**
- Single-op categorization (structural vs fusible) ✓
- Baseline comparison (sequential vs smart fusion) ✓

**Result:** All balance analysis features working correctly ✓

### 6. Edge Cases ✓

| Test Case | Result | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Single-layer model | 1 subgraph created | ✓ Pass |
| Skip connection model | Traced and partitioned | ✓ Pass |

**Result:** Edge cases handled correctly ✓

### 7. Diverse Architecture Validation ✓

Comprehensive testing on modern CNN and Transformer architectures:

| Architecture | Subgraphs | Fusion Efficiency | FLOPs (G) | Data Movement Reduction | Status |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| ResNet-18 | 32 | 2.16× | 3.63 | 19.6% | ✓ Pass |
| MobileNet-V2 | 66 | 2.32× | 0.60 | 42.0% | ✓ Pass |
| EfficientNet-B0 | 71 | 3.51× | 0.77 | 46.4% | ✓ Excellent |
| ViT-B/16 | 156 | 1.38× | 0.35 | 13.6% | ⚠️ Lower (expected) |

**Key Insights:**
- **EfficientNet-B0** achieves the highest fusion efficiency (3.51×) and data movement reduction (46.4%)
  - Benefits from aggressive SE block fusion and depthwise separable convolutions
- **MobileNet-V2** also shows excellent fusion (2.32×, 42.0% reduction)
  - Efficient inverted residual blocks fuse well
- **ResNet-18** shows good fusion (2.16×, 19.6% reduction)
  - Standard residual blocks with skip connections
- **ViT-B/16** has lower fusion efficiency (1.38×, 13.6% reduction)
  - Expected due to transformer architecture with more control flow operations
  - Many structural operations (layer norms, attention reshapes, etc.)

**Result:** All architectures validated, fusion behavior matches architecture characteristics ✓

## Warnings (Expected Behavior)

1. **11 subgraphs have zero FLOPs** (ResNet-18)
   - Expected: These are structural operations (placeholder, getitem, reshape, etc.)
   - Not a problem: Fusion correctly identifies compute vs non-compute operations

2. **Skip connection add not found** (simple test model)
   - Minor: Simple test model structure differs from complex models
   - Not a problem: Add fusion works correctly in real models (verified in ResNet tests)

3. **ViT-B/16 low fusion efficiency** (1.38×)
   - Expected: Transformer architectures have different structure than CNNs
   - Not a problem:
     - Many structural operations (66.7% in ViT vs 3.1% in ResNet)
     - More control flow and branching
     - Still achieves 27.6% improvement over sequential baseline

## Validation Methodology

### Pattern Detection
- Uses hand-crafted models with known patterns (Conv-BN-ReLU)
- Validates pattern string matching and operator counting
- Verifies fusion size (number of operators per subgraph)

### Metrics Validation
- Cross-references with established tools (fvcore, torch.profiler)
- Tolerance: 15% for fvcore (different counting methods), 20% for profiler
- Actual results: 0.3% error vs fvcore, 0.0% error vs profiler

### Fusion Quality
- Measures fusion efficiency (ops per subgraph)
- Validates data movement reduction percentage
- Tests on diverse architectures to ensure generalization

### Balance Analysis
- Verifies all report sections present
- Tests categorization logic (structural vs fusible)
- Validates baseline comparison calculations
