# Session Summary: Graph Partitioning Implementation

**Date**: Session focused on implementing true graph partitioning via operator fusion

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Identified the Real Problem âœ…

**Issue**: The original "partitioner" wasn't actually partitioning - it just created one subgraph per operator.
- ResNet-18: 60 operators â†’ 60 "subgraphs" (not partitioning!)
- No fusion, no aggregation, no reduction in data movement

**Solution**: Implemented fusion-based partitioning to aggregate operators into coarse-grained subgraphs suitable for hardware mapping.

### 2. Enhanced Quick Start Script âœ…

Added FX graph analysis to `examples/quick_start_partitioner.py`:
- Shows all FX node types (call_module, call_function, call_method)
- Displays which nodes get partitioned vs skipped
- Clear breakdown of Conv2d, BatchNorm, ReLU, torch.add, etc.

**Key finding**: GraphPartitioner only processes call_module nodes, missing call_function nodes (torch.add, flatten, etc.)

### 3. Implemented Fusion-Based Partitioner âœ…

Created `src/graphs/characterize/fusion_partitioner.py` (600 lines):

**Algorithm**: Greedy sequential fusion with boundary detection
- Fuse operators sequentially until hitting a boundary
- **Boundaries**: Fork (multiple consumers), Join (multiple inputs), Resource limits

**Fusion patterns detected**:
- Conv2d + BatchNorm2d + ReLU
- Conv2d + BatchNorm2d
- Add + ReLU (residual connections)
- Conv2d + BatchNorm2d + ReLU6 (MobileNet)

**Results**:
- ResNet-18: 60 ops â†’ 32 fused subgraphs (1.9Ã— reduction)
- MobileNet-V2: 141 ops â†’ 66 fused subgraphs (2.1Ã— reduction)

### 4. Measured Data Movement Reduction âœ…

**ResNet-18**:
- 19.6% reduction in global memory traffic
- 19.2 MB of intermediate data stays in cache/registers
- Conv+BN+ReLU fusions: 47-63% memory reduction per subgraph

**MobileNet-V2** (bigger win!):
- 42.0% reduction in memory traffic
- 51.1 MB saved
- Expansion layers: 63% memory reduction (9.6 MB stays in cache!)

**Why MobileNet benefits more**: Inverted residual blocks have more sequential operations, creating larger intermediate tensors that now stay in cache.

### 5. Created Comprehensive Documentation âœ…

**Algorithm design**:
- `docs/GRAPH_PARTITIONING_DESIGN.md` - High-level design
- `docs/FUSION_ALGORITHM_PROPOSAL.md` - Concrete algorithm
- `docs/FX_GRAPH_PARTITIONING.md` - What gets partitioned

**Results**:
- `docs/FUSION_RESULTS.md` - Detailed experimental results and analysis

**Testing**:
- `examples/test_fusion_partitioner.py` - Comparison script

## Key Insights

1. **Fusion is essential for realistic performance modeling**
   - Unfused: 60 tiny kernels with unrealistic assumptions
   - Fused: 32 meaningful execution units we can map to hardware

2. **MobileNet architecture benefits MORE from fusion than ResNet**
   - 42% vs 20% memory reduction
   - Confirms memory-bound models gain more from keeping data in cache

3. **Hardware mapping is now feasible**
   - 32-66 coarse subgraphs can be mapped to GPU SMs, KPU tiles, TPU arrays
   - Each subgraph is a realistic unit of work for scheduling

4. **Data movement is the key metric**
   - Fusion eliminates 20-42% of global memory traffic
   - Intermediate tensors stay in L1/registers instead of DRAM
   - This directly translates to latency reduction on real hardware

## Next Session: Phase 2 - Hardware Mapping

### Goals for Tomorrow

1. **Map fused subgraphs to hardware resources**:
   - GPU: Map subgraphs to SM groups
   - KPU: Map subgraphs to tiles
   - TPU: Map subgraphs to systolic array chunks
   - CPU: Map subgraphs to cores/vector units

2. **Estimate realistic utilization**:
   - Not 100% of 132 SMs on H100
   - Account for actual parallelism from fusion analysis
   - Example: 32 fused subgraphs, max 12 parallel â†’ ~24 SMs active at batch=1

3. **Calculate realistic latency**:
   - Effective FLOPS = Peak FLOPS Ã— utilization
   - Memory-bound operations: Use bandwidth model
   - Fused operations: Account for reduced memory traffic

4. **Validate against reality**:
   - Should fix the 1000Ã— latency error
   - Target: <30% error vs real benchmarks

### Quick Start for Tomorrow

```bash
# Review fusion results
python examples/test_fusion_partitioner.py --model resnet18
python examples/test_fusion_partitioner.py --model mobilenet_v2

# Read Phase 2 plan
cat docs/realistic_performance_modeling_plan.md  # Weeks 3-4 section

# Implementation files to create:
# - src/graphs/characterize/hardware_mapper.py
# - src/graphs/characterize/gpu_mapper.py
# - src/graphs/characterize/kpu_mapper.py
# - examples/test_hardware_mapping.py
```

### Open Questions for Tomorrow

1. **SM allocation strategy**:
   - How to distribute fused subgraphs across SMs?
   - Should we use occupancy calculator?
   - Account for wave quantization?

2. **Tile memory constraints**:
   - KPU tiles have 256KB scratchpad
   - Do fused subgraphs fit?
   - May need to split some larger fusions

3. **Parallelism mapping**:
   - Fusion report shows parallelism per subgraph
   - How to map thread counts to SM allocation?
   - Example: 200K threads â†’ how many SMs?

4. **Latency calculation**:
   - Roofline model: min(compute_time, memory_time)
   - But with fusion, memory time is reduced
   - How to combine fused ops' latencies?

## Success Metrics

**Today's achievements**:
- âœ… True graph partitioning implemented
- âœ… 1.9-2.1Ã— reduction in execution units
- âœ… 20-42% reduction in memory traffic
- âœ… Foundation for hardware mapping ready

**Tomorrow's targets**:
- Map 32 fused subgraphs to realistic SM allocation
- Estimate utilization (not 100%!)
- Calculate realistic H100 latency for ResNet-18/MobileNet
- Compare: Should be 5-10Ã— slower than naive peak estimate

## Code Status

All code is functional and tested:
- `fusion_partitioner.py` works on ResNet-18, MobileNet-V2
- Test script provides comprehensive statistics
- Documentation is complete

**Known issue to fix**:
- FLOP counting discrepancy (fusion partitioner missing call_function nodes)
- Not critical for hardware mapping, but should be fixed for completeness

## Notes for Tomorrow

- Start with GPU mapping (most common target)
- Use fusion statistics (parallelism, memory) for mapping decisions
- Build on existing arch_profiles.py hardware specifications
- Create visualization of how subgraphs map to SMs

Looking forward to Phase 2! ðŸš€
