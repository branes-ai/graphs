## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Battery Life Calculation Error

**Description**: EA-2 table was showing 0.0 hours battery life for all hardware due to units conversion error.

**Implementation**:
- Modified: `examples/test_all_hardware.py` (lines 725-729)
- Root cause: Dividing Wh by J/hour instead of using Power (W) directly
- Fixed formula: `battery_hours = 100.0 / power_w`
- Formula: Battery Life (hours) = Battery Capacity (Wh) / Power Consumption (W)

**Results**:
- KPU-T100 @ 6W: 16.7 hours (battery-powered robots/drones)
- Coral-Edge-TPU: 50.0 hours (ultra-low-power champion)
- Jetson-Thor @ 30W: 3.3 hours (edge AI platform)
- KPU-T300 @ 50W: 2.0 hours (automotive - not battery-optimized)

### 2. Removed Sparsity Inflation from Jetson Thor

**Description**: Updated Jetson Thor specifications to use actual datapath TOPS instead of marketing specs that include workload-dependent sparsity speedups.

**Implementation**:
- Modified: `src/graphs/characterize/hardware_mapper.py` (lines 2002-2161)
- Changed `int8_ops_per_sm_per_clock`: 512 → 256 (actual datapath)
- Changed `fp16_ops_per_sm_per_clock`: 512 → 256
- Peak TOPS: 2000 → 1000 TOPS INT8 (speed-of-light without sparsity)
- Added documentation: "NVIDIA claims: 2000 TOPS INT8 (includes sparsity - workload dependent!)"

**Results**:
- Latency impact: ~2× slower (more realistic performance)
- Before (2000 TOPS): ~5.8 ms
- After (1000 TOPS): ~11.6 ms
- Still competitive at 30W edge deployment envelope
- Fair comparison: All profiles now use actual datapath speed-of-light performance

**Rationale**:
- Marketing peak TOPS often include algorithmic optimizations (sparsity, pruning)
- These speedups are highly workload-dependent and unreliable
- Speed-of-light datapath throughput provides consistent baseline for comparison

### 3. Replaced KPU T250 with T300 Configuration

**Description**: Updated KPU configuration from T250 (250 tiles) to T300 (300 tiles) for automotive AI workloads.

**Implementation**:
- Modified 3 files:
  - `src/graphs/characterize/hardware_mapper.py` (lines 1209-1514): Added `kpu_t300_resource_model()`
  - `src/graphs/characterize/kpu_mapper.py` (lines 463-477): Added `create_kpu_t300_mapper()`
  - `examples/test_all_hardware.py` (lines 119-121): Updated mapper configuration

**Configuration Changes**:
- Tile count: 250 → 300 tiles
- INT8 tiles: 175 → 210 (70% of total)
- BF16 tiles: 50 → 60 (20% of total)
- Matrix tiles: 25 → 30 (10% of total)
- Power profiles: 12.5W / 25W / 50W (automotive thermal envelopes)

**Results**:
- KPU-T300 @ 12.5W: ~3.3× faster than T100 @ 6W
- KPU-T300 @ 25W: ~3.5× faster than T100 @ 6W
- KPU-T300 @ 50W: ~3.7× faster than T100 @ 6W
- ~20% performance improvement over old T250 configuration
- Clear SKU differentiation: T100 (embodied AI) vs T300 (automotive)

### 4. Added Sorting and Ranking to Analysis Tables

**Description**: Enhanced three analysis tables with ranking and proper sorting for better readability.

**Implementation**:
- Modified: `examples/test_all_hardware.py`
- **EA-3 (Power vs Performance)**: Ranked by Perf/Watt (lines 745-807)
  - Metric: inferences/sec/W (higher is better)
  - Added Rank column, sorted descending
- **ANALYSIS 5 (Head-to-Head)**: Ranked by speedup vs CPU (lines 314-347)
  - Metric: Speedup vs Intel CPU (higher is better)
  - Added KPU-T300 @ 50W as automotive reference
  - Sorted descending
- **ANALYSIS 6 (Cost-Benefit)**: Ranked by Perf/$ (lines 352-441)
  - Metric: inferences/sec/$ (higher is better)
  - Added Rank and Perf/$ columns
  - Sorted descending

**Results**:
- Tables now immediately show best/worst performers
- Clear decision-making aid for hardware selection
- Actionable insights for different use cases (battery, automotive, cloud)

### 5. Updated Hardware Costs

**Description**: Updated hardware costs to reflect realistic market prices.

**Implementation**:
- Modified: `examples/test_all_hardware.py` (lines 358-385)
- KPU-T300 @ 50W: $1,800 → $1,200 (volume pricing)
- TPU v4: $5,000 → $15,000 (minimum pod slice configuration)

**Results**:
- TPU v4 Perf/$ dropped to 0.001 (3× worse than before)
- More accurate cost-benefit comparison
- Shows cloud hardware cost penalty for edge deployment
- KPU-T100 @ 6W remains embodied AI cost champion

### 6. Enhanced Table Formatting

**Description**: Widened first column in testing tables to accommodate longer hardware names.

**Implementation**:
- Modified: `examples/test_all_hardware.py` (lines 165-166, 179, 181)
- Column width: 25 → 30 characters
- Applied to all three precision test result tables (FP32, BF16, INT8)

**Results**:
- Hardware names like "KPU-T300 @ 50W (210/60/30)" now fit properly
- Cleaner table formatting
- Better readability

### 7. Aligned Target Categories

## Key Insights

1. **Sparsity Inflation in Marketing Specs is Misleading**:
   - NVIDIA's 2000 TOPS INT8 claim includes workload-dependent sparsity speedups
   - Actual datapath: 1000 TOPS INT8 (speed-of-light without algorithmic optimizations)
   - Impact: Fair hardware comparisons require using actual silicon throughput, not marketing peaks
   - Action: Always verify if peak specs include algorithmic optimizations vs pure datapath performance

2. **Jetson Thor vs KPU Trade-offs**:
   - Jetson Thor @ 30W: Faster absolute performance (2.5× more TOPS even when throttled)
     - Advantage: 3-5× more silicon (60-80 SMs, larger die area)
     - Cost: $3,000 (datacenter-class chip in edge form factor)
   - KPU-T300 @ 50W: Better efficiency (53% less energy, 50% lower cost)
     - Advantage: Purpose-built for embodied AI, efficient tile architecture
     - Cost: $1,200 (specialized accelerator)
   - Impact: Clear market segmentation - raw performance (Jetson) vs efficiency/cost (KPU)
   - Action: Choose based on deployment constraints (power budget, cost sensitivity, software ecosystem)

3. **KPU SKU Strategy is Well-Designed**:
   - T100 (100 tiles, 6-24W): Battery-powered robots, drones, mobile robots
   - T300 (300 tiles, 12.5-50W): Autonomous vehicles with liquid cooling
   - Both use same 70/20/10 tile ratio (INT8/BF16/Matrix)
   - Impact: 3× tile count provides ~3.5× performance improvement
   - Action: Clear differentiation by thermal envelope enables targeted market positioning

4. **Cloud Hardware Has Massive Cost Penalty for Edge**:
   - TPU v4 cost: $15,000 (minimum pod slice)
   - Perf/$: 0.001 inf/sec/$ (among worst in analysis)
   - H100 GPU: $30,000, similar poor Perf/$
   - Impact: Cloud accelerators are economically non-viable for edge deployment
   - Action: Edge AI requires purpose-built hardware (KPU, Coral, Jetson)

5. **Battery Life is Critical Differentiator for Embodied AI**:
   - KPU-T100 @ 6W: 16.7 hours (100 Wh battery)
   - Coral-Edge-TPU: 50.0 hours (ultra-low-power champion)
   - Jetson-Thor @ 30W: 3.3 hours (edge AI platform)
   - Impact: 5× difference in battery life between 6W and 30W platforms

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Battery Life Showing 0.0 Hours

**Issue**: EA-2 table was showing 0.0 hours battery life for all hardware configurations.

**Root Cause**: Units conversion error in calculation:
```python
# Wrong (old code):
inferences_per_hour = 3600 / alloc.total_latency
energy_per_hour = energy_j * inferences_per_hour
battery_hours = 100 / energy_per_hour  # Wrong units! (Wh / J/hour)

# Correct (new code):
power_w = energy_j / alloc.total_latency  # Power (W) = Energy (J) / Time (s)
battery_hours = 100.0 / power_w  # Battery Life = Capacity (Wh) / Power (W)
```

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Direct calculation - **Worked!** Simple formula is correct.

**Final Solution**: Use direct formula: Battery Life (hours) = 100 Wh / Power (W)

**Lessons Learned**: Keep formulas simple. Units errors are easier to spot in simple expressions.

### Challenge 2: Understanding Jetson Thor vs KPU Performance Difference

**Issue**: User asked why Jetson Thor @ 30W beats KPU-T250 @ 50W in latency despite KPU having higher power budget.

**Analysis**:
- Jetson Thor: 3-5× more silicon (60-80 SMs, larger die, $3,000)
- Even throttled to 30W (57% of boost clock), absolute TOPS is higher
- KPU: Specialized tiles, smaller die, $1,200

**Final Solution**: Provided detailed comparison showing:
- Jetson Thor: Better raw performance (more silicon)
- KPU: Better efficiency (53% less energy) and cost (50% cheaper)
- Trade-off is clear: performance vs efficiency/cost

**Lessons Learned**: Silicon area matters. More transistors = more performance, even when throttled.

## Session Notes

### Decisions Made
1. **Use actual datapath TOPS, not marketing peaks**: Remove sparsity inflation from Jetson Thor
   - Rationale: Fair comparison requires consistent baseline (speed-of-light silicon performance)
   - Impact: All hardware now uses actual datapath throughput

2. **Replace KPU T250 with T300**: Higher tile count for automotive AI
   - Rationale: 300 tiles better represents automotive compute requirements
   - Impact: ~20% performance improvement, clearer SKU differentiation

3. **Add ranking to all comparison tables**: Improve readability
   - Rationale: Users need to quickly identify best option for their use case
   - Impact: Tables are now actionable decision-making tools

4. **Update TPU v4 cost to $15K**: Reflect realistic minimum configuration
   - Rationale: $5K was too optimistic for actual deployment cost
   - Impact: Shows true cost penalty of cloud hardware for edge deployment

### Deferred Work
1. **KPU T500 configuration**: Potential ultra-high-performance automotive SKU
   - Why deferred: Need to validate market demand and thermal feasibility
   - When to revisit: After T300 validation with automotive partners

2. **Dynamic DVFS modeling**: More detailed voltage/frequency scaling model
   - Why deferred: Empirical derate factors are sufficient for Phase 2
   - When to revisit: Phase 3 if higher accuracy is needed

### Technical Debt
1. **Dependency tracking in fusion partitioner**: Still using workaround (3 ops/stage)
   - Priority: Medium (doesn't affect current analysis)
   - Plan: Fix in Phase 3 when implementing advanced fusion patterns

2. **Batch size scaling validation**: Only tested batch=1
   - Priority: Medium (batch=1 is primary use case for embodied AI)
   - Plan: Add batch scaling analysis next week
