## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Limited Documentation for DSP Performance

**Issue**: DSP datasheets often don't provide clear effective TOPS (only peak specs).

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Use peak TOPS directly - Too optimistic (100% utilization unrealistic)
2. Apply fixed efficiency factor - Used 60% based on Hexagon architecture papers

**Final Solution**:
- Applied 60% efficiency factor for QRB5165 (based on literature)
- TI TDA4VM uses clock throttling model (85% @ 10W, 95% @ 20W)
- Added note that real hardware calibration needed

**Lessons Learned**: DSP performance is highly workload-dependent. Need real hardware validation.

### Challenge 2: Modeling Heterogeneous Execution

**Issue**: QRB5165 has CPU + GPU + DSP, but our mapper only models DSP portion.

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Model all three compute units - Too complex for now
2. Model DSP only with equivalent processing elements - Chosen approach

**Final Solution**:
- Mapped DSP to 32 equivalent processing elements
- Acknowledged limitation in documentation
- Future work: Model heterogeneous concurrent execution

**Lessons Learned**: Start simple (DSP-only), add complexity later when needed.

## Session Notes

### Decisions Made

1. **DSP as New Hardware Type**: Created `HardwareType.DSP` (not subtype of CPU or GPU)
   - Rationale: DSPs have unique characteristics (vector + scalar, specialized instructions)
   - Consistent with existing type system

2. **60% Efficiency Factor for QRB5165**: Conservative estimate based on Hexagon architecture
   - Rationale: DSPs rarely achieve 100% utilization due to memory bottlenecks
   - Can be tuned later with real hardware data

3. **Dual Thermal Profiles for TDA4VM**: 10W (front camera) and 20W (full ADAS)
   - Rationale: Automotive systems scale from single camera to full surround view
   - Matches real-world deployment scenarios

### Deferred Work

1. **Heterogeneous Execution Modeling**: Deferred to future phase
   - Reason: Too complex for initial DSP mapper implementation
   - When to revisit: After basic DSP validation complete

2. **Safety Core Overhead**: Deferred for TDA4VM
   - Reason: Need more detailed AUTOSAR profiling data
   - When to revisit: When automotive comparison tool is built

### Technical Debt

1. **QRB5165 Low Utilization Issue**: Need to investigate 3.6% ViT-Base utilization
   - Priority: Medium (may be accurate, but worth checking)

2. **Real Hardware Calibration**: All DSP models based on datasheets only
   - Priority: High (need validation for accuracy claims)

## Conclusion

Successfully added two DSP mappers representing distinct use cases:
- **QRB5165**: Robotics/edge AI (heterogeneous, multi-modal)
- **TDA4VM**: Automotive ADAS (safety-critical, deterministic)

Both mappers follow the established hardware mapper pattern and integrate cleanly into the edge AI comparison framework. Key finding: DSPs sit in a "middle ground" between fixed-function accelerators (Hailo) and flexible GPUs (Jetson), with trade-offs in power efficiency, flexibility, and ecosystem support.

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Next**: Build automotive ADAS comparison tool using TDA4VM mapper
