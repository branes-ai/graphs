# Session Summaries

This directory contains detailed session-by-session work logs for the graph characterization and partitioning project.

## How to Use Session Summaries

### For Daily Work
1. **Start of session**: Review previous session summary
2. **During session**: Take notes on accomplishments, challenges, insights
3. **End of session**: Create new summary using `template.md`
4. **Update**: Add entry to main `CHANGELOG.md`

### For Review
1. **Weekly review**: Read summaries from past week
2. **Monthly review**: Look at trends, accomplishments, challenges
3. **Onboarding**: Read recent summaries to understand current work

### For Planning
1. **Next steps**: Check "Next Steps" section of latest summary
2. **Open questions**: Review "Open Questions" across recent summaries
3. **Technical debt**: Track accumulated debt items

## Session Index

### Phase 2: Hardware Mapping (Weeks 3-4)
- `2025-10-21_hardware_mapping_start.md` - Starting Phase 2

### Phase 1: Graph Partitioning (Weeks 1-2)
- `2025-10-20_fusion_partitioning.md` - Fusion-based partitioning implementation
- `2025-10-19_graph_partitioning.md` - Graph partitioning & concurrency analysis

### Foundation
- Earlier work captured in main documentation

---

## Template Usage

To create a new session summary:

```bash
# Copy template
cp docs/sessions/template.md docs/sessions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_topic_name.md

# Edit the new file
vim docs/sessions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_topic_name.md
```

**Important**: Fill in all sections! Even if brief, having structure helps with:
- Review and planning
- Understanding context weeks/months later
- Onboarding new team members
- Debugging ("what were we thinking?")

---

## Session Naming Convention

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_short_topic_description.md`

**Examples**:
- `2025-10-20_fusion_partitioning.md`
- `2025-10-21_gpu_hardware_mapper.md`
- `2025-10-22_attention_fusion_poc.md`

**Guidelines**:
- Use lowercase
- Use underscores for spaces
- Keep topic brief (3-5 words max)
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD

## What to Include

### Always Include
- Goals for the session
- What was accomplished
- Key insights
- Files created/modified
- Next steps

### Include When Relevant
- Validation/testing results
- Challenges & solutions
- Code snippets/examples
- Metrics & statistics
- Open questions
- Decisions made

### Optional
- References (docs, external resources)
- Raw data/outputs
- Screenshots/diagrams
- Session notes

## Tips for Good Session Summaries

### Be Specific
❌ "Fixed some bugs in the partitioner"
✅ "Fixed off-by-one error in fusion boundary detection (line 234) causing incorrect subgraph counts for ResNet-18"

### Include Numbers
❌ "Improved performance significantly"
✅ "Reduced memory traffic by 42% (51.1 MB) for MobileNet-V2"

### Capture Insights
❌ "Tested the code"
✅ "Discovered MobileNet benefits more from fusion (42% vs 20% for ResNet) due to inverted residual blocks with more sequential ops"

### Document Decisions
❌ "Decided to use greedy algorithm"
✅ "Chose greedy sequential fusion over optimal (NP-hard) because: (1) 5× faster, (2) within 10% of optimal for tested models, (3) easier to debug"

### Link Context
Include references to:
- Related session summaries
- Relevant documentation
- External resources
- Code locations
