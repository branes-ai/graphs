# Session: Hardware Architecture Taxonomy & KPU Documentation Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Focus**: Investigating KPU misinformation and creating comprehensive hardware architecture reference
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Problem Statement

### Issue: KPU Attributed Non-Existent Features

**User Report**: "When Claude chatbot looked at this repo, it summarized the benefits of the KPU to be delivered by sparsity and gating."

**Question**: Is this bad data in the repo or hallucination by the chatbots?

**Concern**: External users and AI assistants may be receiving incorrect information about KPU hardware capabilities, potentially affecting architectural decisions and research.

---

## Investigation

### Step 1: Search for Sparsity/Gating References

**Search Strategy**:
```bash
# Search for sparsity and gating across the repository
grep -r "(sparsity|sparse|gating|gate)" --include="*.py" --include="*.md"
```

**Findings**: No references in actual KPU implementation code.

### Step 2: Review KPU Mapper Implementation

**File Reviewed**: `src/graphs/hardware/mappers/accelerators/kpu.py` (568 lines)

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Stream processing with tile-based architecture
- ✅ Scratchpad memory constraints (256KB per tile)
- ✅ Tiling overhead modeling
- ✅ Quantization optimization (INT8/INT4)
- ✅ Energy efficiency modeling
- ❌ **ZERO references to sparsity**
- ❌ **ZERO references to gating**

**Conclusion**: KPU mapper implementation is clean - no sparsity or gating features.

### Step 3: Check KPU Architecture Documentation

**File Reviewed**: `docs/kpu_architecture.md` (620 lines)

**Content Analysis**:
- Stream processing vs weight-stationary dataflow ✓
- Checkerboard floorplan and tile architecture ✓
- Heterogeneous tile composition (70% INT8, 20% BF16, 10% FP32) ✓
- Scaling strategies ✓
- **No mention of sparsity or gating** ✓

### Step 4: Locate Source of Misinformation

**Found**: `tbd/demo_rich_visualization.py` and `tbd/demo_rich_viz_standalone.py`

**Problematic Code** (lines 176-180 in demo_rich_visualization.py):
```python
{
    'name': 'Sparsity Engine<br/>~45% zeros skipped',
    'latency_ms': -0.4,
    'energy_uj': -5,
    'notes': 'Optimization',
}
```

**Root Cause Identified**:
- Files in `tbd/` (to-be-done) directory contain **fictional marketing data** for visualization demos
- Data was **never meant to represent actual KPU hardware capabilities**
- No disclaimer or warning that this is made-up demo data
- Chatbots reading the repo correctly parsed the files but incorrectly assumed data was factual

**Impact**:
- Misleading information propagated to users asking chatbots about KPU
- Potentially influenced architectural decisions based on false capabilities
- Damaged credibility of KPU documentation

**Verdict**: **This is BAD DATA in the repository, NOT hallucination by chatbots.**

## Solution Design

### Approach 1: Fix Immediate Problem

**Options Considered**:
1. Delete demo files (too aggressive, might be useful for visualization work)
2. Add prominent disclaimers to demo files
3. Move demo files to archive with clear labeling
4. Replace fictional data with actual KPU benefits

**Chosen**: Document in CHANGELOG and session log, recommend cleanup.

### Approach 2: Prevent Future Misinformation

**Problem**: No single authoritative source explaining hardware architecture differences.

**Observation**:
- Users and AI assistants need to understand fundamental differences between CPU, GPU, TPU, KPU, etc.
- Existing docs scattered across multiple files
- No comprehensive taxonomy of execution models

**Solution**: Create **Hardware Architecture Taxonomy** document covering:
- All 7 hardware architectures in the repository
- Execution paradigms (MIMD, SIMT, VLIW, Systolic, Dataflow)
- Real benefits and bottlenecks of each architecture
- Mapper implementation strategies
- Architecture selection guide

## Implementation

### Part 1: Hardware Architecture Taxonomy Document

**Created**: `docs/hardware/architecture_taxonomy.md` (650+ lines)

#### Structure

**Section 1: Overview**
- Key insight: Hardware differs in HOW they execute computational graphs
- Flynn's Taxonomy (extended for modern accelerators)
- Execution paradigms classification

**Section 2: Architectural Classifications**
- Flynn's Taxonomy table (MIMD, SIMT, VLIW, Systolic, Spatial Dataflow)

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Demo Data Needs Clear Disclaimers

**Problem**: Fictional data in demo files propagated as fact.

**Root Cause**: No warning that `tbd/demo_*.py` files contain made-up marketing data.

**Solution**: Always add prominent disclaimers to demo/visualization files:
```python
"""
WARNING: This file contains FICTIONAL demo data for visualization purposes only.
The performance numbers are NOT based on actual hardware measurements.
DO NOT use this data for architectural decisions or performance claims.

For real KPU specifications, see: docs/kpu_architecture.md
For real KPU mapper implementation, see: src/graphs/hardware/mappers/accelerators/kpu.py
"""
```

**Recommendation**: Audit all files in `tbd/`, `examples/`, `archive/` for similar issues.

### Lesson 2: Need Single Source of Truth

**Observation**: Information about hardware scattered across many files made it hard for users and AI to find authoritative information.

**Solution**: Create comprehensive taxonomy as single source of truth.

**Best Practice**:
- One canonical document per major topic
- Other docs reference canonical source
- Clear "start here" pointers

### Lesson 3: AI Assistants Are Literal

**Insight**: Chatbots will faithfully report what's in the repository, even if it's demo data.

**Implication**: Repository content quality directly affects AI-generated responses.

**Action**: Treat all repository content as potentially AI-readable; maintain high accuracy standards.

### Lesson 4: Taxonomy Improves Comprehension

**Benefit**: Organizing by execution paradigm (MIMD, SIMT, VLIW, etc.) makes differences immediately clear.

**Example**: Users now understand why:
- TPU needs large batches (weight loading overhead)
- GPU needs thousands of threads (hide latency)
- KPU works well at batch=1 (stream processing)

**Principle**: Classification taxonomies aid learning and mental models.
