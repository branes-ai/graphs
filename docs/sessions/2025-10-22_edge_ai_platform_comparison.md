## Lessons Learned

### 1. Workload Specialization Matters
- Hailo excels on target workloads (ResNet-50)
- Hailo fails on non-standard models (DeepLabV3+: 22.6s!)
- Lesson: Fixed-function = high efficiency OR flexibility, not both

### 2. DVFS Throttling is Real
- Marketing: Jetson Nano "40 TOPS INT8"
- Reality: ~2 TOPS effective @ 7W (5% of peak!)
- Lesson: Sustained performance ≠ peak performance

### 3. Efficiency Factor Dominates
- KPU: 60-78% efficiency_factor → best TOPS/W
- Jetson: 4-10% efficiency_factor → poor TOPS/W
- Lesson: Silicon efficiency matters more than raw TOPS

### 4. Heterogeneous Tiles Win
- KPU's 70/20/10 (INT8/BF16/Matrix) handles all workloads
- Single-function tiles (GPU, Hailo) have utilization issues
- Lesson: Workload-driven allocation beats one-size-fits-all

### 5. Power Budget Defines Category
- ≤10W: Battery-powered (drones, robots)
- ≤50W: Tethered (vehicles, servers)
- Different winners for different budgets
