classification:
  type: "calibration"
  priority: "high"
  milestone: "M3"
  target_version: "0.9.0-beta"
  estimated_effort: "4h"
  complexity: "low"

objective: |
  Run the calibration workflow on available hardware to produce
  initial calibration profiles:
  - Run full benchmark suite with power measurement
  - Fit roofline, energy, and utilization parameters
  - Generate calibration profiles for each hardware platform
  - Document calibration methodology and results
  - Validate improved estimation accuracy

motivation: |
  With calibration infrastructure complete, we need to:
  - Produce usable calibration data for at least one platform
  - Validate the calibration workflow end-to-end
  - Establish baseline accuracy improvements
  - Identify any issues in the calibration pipeline
  - Create reference profiles for testing
