# New Operations Support - Pooling and Elementwise

## Summary

Added support for previously unsupported operations in the graph partitioner:
- **MaxPool2d** - Max pooling operations
- **AdaptiveAvgPool2d** - Adaptive average pooling
- **Elementwise operations** - Add, multiply, subtract, divide (residual connections)

These operations were appearing as warnings in fvcore comparisons but are now fully supported.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Call Function Node Support

**Previous**: Only processed `call_module` nodes (nn.Conv2d, nn.Linear, etc.)
**Now**: Also processes `call_function` nodes (torch.add, torch.mul, etc.)

**Implementation**: Added `_analyze_function_node()` method to handle functional operations.

```python
# New partition logic
call_module_nodes = [node for node in fx_graph.graph.nodes if node.op == 'call_module']
call_function_nodes = [node for node in fx_graph.graph.nodes if node.op == 'call_function']

# Process both types
for node in call_module_nodes:
    subgraph = self._analyze_node(node, fx_graph)

for node in call_function_nodes:
    subgraph = self._analyze_function_node(node, fx_graph)  # NEW
```

### 2. Pooling Operations (MaxPool, AvgPool, AdaptiveAvgPool)

**FLOP Counting**: 0 FLOPs
- MaxPool: Performs comparisons (not arithmetic operations)
- AvgPool/AdaptiveAvgPool: Could count as FLOPs but fvcore doesn't, so we match their convention

**Memory Traffic**: Calculated based on input/output tensor sizes

**Parallelism**: Computed based on output spatial dimensions

```python
elif op_type in [OperationType.MAXPOOL, OperationType.AVGPOOL]:
    # FVCore doesn't count these, so we return 0 to match
    return 0, 0

elif op_type == OperationType.ADAPTIVEAVGPOOL:
    return 0, 0
```

### 3. Elementwise Operations (Add, Mul, Sub, Div)

**FLOP Counting**: 1 FLOP per element

**Common Use**: Residual connections in ResNet (`x = conv(x) + skip`)

**Memory Traffic**: Input tensors + output tensor (no weights)

```python
elif op_type == OperationType.ELEMENTWISE:
    # Element-wise operations: 1 FLOP per element
    total_elements = 1
    for dim in meta.shape:
        total_elements *= dim

    flops = total_elements
    macs = 0
    return flops, macs
```

## ResNet-18 Example

### Operations Now Counted

| Operation | Count | FLOPs | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| MaxPool2d | 1 | 0 | After first conv |
| AdaptiveAvgPool2d | 1 | 0 | Before final FC layer |
| Add (residual) | 8 | 0.8M | Residual connections |

**Residual Add Operations**:
```
add     : 200,704 FLOPs (1×64×56×56)   - layer1.0 skip connection
add_1   : 200,704 FLOPs (1×64×56×56)   - layer1.1 skip connection
add_2   : 100,352 FLOPs (1×128×28×28)  - layer2.0 skip connection
add_3   : 100,352 FLOPs (1×128×28×28)  - layer2.1 skip connection
add_4   :  50,176 FLOPs (1×256×14×14)  - layer3.0 skip connection
add_5   :  50,176 FLOPs (1×256×14×14)  - layer3.1 skip connection
add_6   :  25,088 FLOPs (1×512×7×7)    - layer4.0 skip connection
add_7   :  25,088 FLOPs (1×512×7×7)    - layer4.1 skip connection
-------------------------
Total:  752,640 FLOPs (~0.8M)
```

### Impact on Total FLOP Count

**Before** (only Conv2d/Linear/BatchNorm/ReLU):
- Total FLOPs: 3.643 GFLOPs
- Total MACs: 1.814 GMACs

**After** (including Add operations):
- Total FLOPs: 3.644 GFLOPs (+0.001 GFLOPs from adds)
- Total MACs: 1.814 GMACs (unchanged - adds aren't MACs)

**Change**: +0.001 GFLOPs (0.03% increase)

## Implementation Details

### New Method: `_analyze_function_node()`

Handles `call_function` nodes similar to how `_analyze_node()` handles `call_module` nodes.

**Supported Functions**:
- `add` - Element-wise addition
- `mul` - Element-wise multiplication
- `sub` - Element-wise subtraction
- `div` - Element-wise division
- `flatten` - Skipped (view operation, no FLOPs)

**Function Classification**:
```python
func_name = node.target.__name__
if func_name in ['add', 'mul', 'sub', 'div']:
    op_type = OperationType.ELEMENTWISE
elif func_name == 'flatten':
    return None  # Skip view operations
```

### Updated Parallelism Computation

Added support for pooling operations to compute parallelism dimensions:

```python
elif isinstance(module, (nn.MaxPool2d, nn.AvgPool2d, nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d)):
    # Pooling operations use output dimensions
    B = meta.shape[0] if len(meta.shape) >= 1 else 1
    C = meta.shape[1] if len(meta.shape) >= 2 else 1
    H = meta.shape[2] if len(meta.shape) >= 3 else 1
    W = meta.shape[3] if len(meta.shape) >= 4 else 1

    return ParallelismDescriptor(
        batch=B,
        channels=C,
        spatial=H * W,
        total_threads=B * C * H * W,
        vectorizable_dim='channels'
    )
```

## FVCore Warnings

The warnings from fvcore still appear:
```
Unsupported operator aten::max_pool2d encountered 1 time(s)
Unsupported operator aten::add_ encountered 8 time(s)
```

**These are fvcore's own warnings** - fvcore doesn't support these operators. Our tool now fully supports them!

**Why fvcore doesn't count them**:
1. **MaxPool**: No arithmetic operations (just comparisons)
2. **Add**: Small contribution compared to Conv/Linear

**Our approach**:
- Match fvcore for pooling (0 FLOPs)
- Count adds for completeness (1 FLOP per element)
- Clearly document what's included

## Verification

Run the verification script:
```bash
python cli/verify_new_ops.py
```

Expected output:
```
Expected vs Actual:
  ✓ maxpool: expected 1, got 1
  ✓ adaptiveavgpool: expected 1, got 1
  ✓ elementwise: expected 8, got 8
```

## Comparison with FVCore

| Metric | Our Tool | FVCore | Match? |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Total MACs | 1.814 GMACs | 1.819 GMACs | ✓ 0.27% |
| Conv2d/Linear | Perfect match | Perfect match | ✓ 0.00% |
| MaxPool | 0 FLOPs (counted) | Not counted | ✓ Same |
| Add operations | 0.8M FLOPs | Not counted | - Different |

**Our total is slightly higher** (3.644 vs 3.643) because we count add operations.

**This is correct behavior** - we provide a more complete analysis while still matching fvcore on the core Conv/Linear operations.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

python tests/validate_arithmetic_intensity.py
```

All 7 tests should still pass with the new operations.

### Integration Tests

Compare with fvcore:
```bash
python cli/fvcore_compare.py --model resnet18
```

Expected:

- Per-layer Conv2d/Linear: 0.00% difference ✓
- New operations counted correctly ✓

### Verification Script

Check new operations specifically:
```bash
python cli/verify_new_ops.py
```

Shows:
- 1 MaxPool operation
- 1 AdaptiveAvgPool operation
- 8 Elementwise (add) operations
