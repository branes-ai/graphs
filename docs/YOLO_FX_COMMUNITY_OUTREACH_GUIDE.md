## 📋 Posting Checklist

Before posting:
- [ ] Search existing issues for "FX", "symbolic_trace", "torch.fx"
- [ ] Verify environment versions (PyTorch 2.7.1, ultralytics 8.3.159)
- [ ] Test both YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 to show it's consistent
- [ ] Have minimal reproducible code ready
- [ ] Prepare to share full error traces if requested

When posting:
- [ ] Use clear, descriptive title with "[Question]" or "[Feature Request]"
- [ ] Include minimal reproducible example
- [ ] Explain your use case (hardware estimation for automotive)
- [ ] Ask specific questions (see template)
- [ ] Offer to help test solutions

After posting:
- [ ] Monitor for responses daily
- [ ] Provide additional info promptly if requested
- [ ] Update thread if you find workarounds
- [ ] Share solutions back to community

## 🔑 Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Why FX (not TorchScript):**
   - Need graph IR for operation-level analysis
   - TorchScript provides compiled model, not computation graph
   - Required for hardware resource mapping

2. **Real-world impact:**
   - Automotive ADAS applications (safety-critical)
   - Hardware targets: TI TDA4VM, Qualcomm Hexagon, NVIDIA Jetson
   - Performance requirements: 30 FPS, <100ms latency

3. **Current workaround:**
   - Using ResNet-50/FCN proxies
   - Works but less accurate than real YOLO
   - Would prefer actual YOLO if FX tracing possible

4. **Willingness to help:**
   - Happy to test solutions
   - Can provide performance data
   - Willing to contribute fixes

## 🔍 Search Terms to Use

When searching existing issues:
- "FX trace"
- "torch.fx"
- "symbolic_trace"
- "Proxy object cannot be iterated"
- "FX compatibility"
- "graph mode"
- "torch.cat Proxy"

## 💡 Expected Outcomes

### Possible Responses:

1. **"This is not supported"**
   - Ask if there are plans to support it
   - Request as feature enhancement
   - Ask for architectural reasons why it's difficult

2. **"Use this workaround"**
   - Test immediately and report results
   - Ask about performance/accuracy implications
   - Document the solution for others

3. **"There's a custom implementation"**
   - Request link to repo/branch
   - Offer to test and provide feedback
   - Consider contributing if it works

4. **"Try this flag/argument"**
   - Test with provided configuration
   - Report success/failure
   - Ask about documentation updates

---

## 📊 Information to Collect from Responses

If someone provides a solution:
1. **Implementation details:**
   - Which model version/branch?
   - Required dependencies?
   - Configuration flags?

2. **Limitations:**
   - Any accuracy trade-offs?
   - Performance implications?
   - Compatibility with different YOLO variants?

3. **Documentation:**
   - Is this documented anywhere?
   - Can we help improve docs?
   - Should we create examples?

---

## 🔄 Follow-up Actions

Based on community feedback:

### If FX tracing is possible:
1. Update `automotive_models.py` with real YOLO implementations
2. Test performance vs proxy models
3. Document the solution in project README
4. Contribute back to community (blog post, PR to docs)

### If FX tracing is not possible:
1. Document architectural reasons
2. Validate proxy model approach is appropriate
3. Consider alternative approaches (custom FX-compatible YOLO)
4. Focus on improving proxy model accuracy

### If workarounds exist:
1. Implement and test thoroughly
2. Compare results with proxy models
3. Update documentation with pros/cons
4. Share findings with community

## 📞 Escalation Path

If you don't get responses after:

**1 week:**
- Bump the issue politely
- Cross-post to forum if originally on GitHub (or vice versa)
- Add "help wanted" or "question" labels

**2 weeks:**
- Reach out to specific maintainers (check CONTRIBUTORS)
- Post to broader PyTorch community channels
- Consider creating a standalone demo repo

**1 month:**
- Document as "known limitation"
- Focus on optimizing proxy model approach
- Consider custom FX-compatible YOLO implementation
- Write blog post about the investigation

## ✅ Success Metrics

You've succeeded when:
- [ ] You have a definitive answer (possible/not possible/workaround)
- [ ] You've tested any proposed solutions
- [ ] You've documented the outcome for others
- [ ] You've contributed back to the community
- [ ] You've made a decision on approach (real YOLO vs proxy)

## 📝 Template Response Examples

### If asking for clarification:
```
Thanks for the response! Just to clarify:
- Does this work with torch.fx.symbolic_trace specifically (not torch.jit.trace)?
- Which YOLO version should I use (yolov5s, yolov8n, etc.)?
- Are there any known limitations or trade-offs?

I'm happy to test this and report back with results.
```

### If solution works:
```
This worked! Here's what I did:
[steps]

Performance comparison:
- Tracing time: X seconds
- Model size: Y MB
- Inference latency: Z ms

I'm documenting this in our project and will share findings. Thanks!
```

### If solution doesn't work:
```
I tried this but encountered:
[error message]

Environment:
- PyTorch: 2.7.1
- ultralytics: 8.3.159

Code:
[minimal example]

Am I missing something? Happy to provide more details.
```
