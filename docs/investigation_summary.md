**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Tasks Completed:** Refactoring, mapper variant creation, RCA
**Status:** Refactoring complete, Investigation reveals integration issue

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Complete Refactoring: `empirical_derate` → `efficiency_factor`

**Rationale:** The term "derate" implies reduction (e.g., "derate by 30%" = make 30% slower), but the coefficient actually represents the **fraction of performance achieved** (e.g., 0.70 = achieve 70% efficiency).

**Files Updated:**
- `src/graphs/characterize/hardware_mapper.py` - Core dataclass and calculation
- `src/graphs/characterize/cpu_mapper.py` - All CPU-specific code
- `validation/empirical/calibration_analysis.py` - Analysis tool
- `validation/empirical/sweep_mlp.py` - Sweep harness
- `validation/empirical/README.md` - Documentation
- `validation/empirical/WORKFLOW_EXAMPLE.md` - Examples
- `validation/empirical/results/*.md` - Generated reports

**Result:** 0 occurrences of "empirical_derate" remaining in codebase.

### 2. Created i7-12700K Large Model Mapper Variant

**Files Created:**
- `src/graphs/characterize/cpu_mapper.py:651` - `create_i7_12700k_large_mapper()`
- `docs/I7_12700K_MAPPER_VARIANTS.md` - Comprehensive comparison documentation
- `validation/hardware/compare_i7_12700k_mappers.py` - Comparison script

**Key Differences:**

| Coefficient | Tiny Models | Large Models | Ratio |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| efficiency_factor | 0.20 | 0.60 | 3.0× |
| memory_bottleneck_factor | 0.25 | 0.65 | 2.6× |
| tile_utilization | 0.50 | 0.80 | 1.6× |
| instruction_efficiency | 0.65 | 0.80 | 1.2× |
| **Effective ops/sec** | **72 GFLOPS** | **345.6 GFLOPS** | **4.8×** |

**Calibration Status:**
- Tiny mapper: ✅ Empirically calibrated (MAPE: 20% on tiny MLPs)
- Large mapper: ⚠ Estimated (needs calibration sweep on large models)

### 3. Created Unit Tests

**File:** `validation/hardware/test_performance_characteristics.py`

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Mapper initialization - Verifies thermal profiles are set
2. ✅ Performance characteristics - Verifies coefficients are different
3. ✅ Latency calculation - Verifies `_calculate_latency()` uses efficiency_factor

**Key Finding:** The `_calculate_latency()` method **DOES use efficiency_factor correctly** and produces a 4.80× difference in compute time between mappers.

### 4. Discovered Integration Issue

**Problem:** While `_calculate_latency()` correctly uses efficiency_factor, the full `map_graph()` pipeline produces **identical latency predictions** for both mapper variants.

**Evidence:**
```
Unit test (_calculate_latency direct):
  Tiny: 13.889 ms compute time
  Large: 2.894 ms compute time
  Ratio: 4.80× ✅ CORRECT

Comparison script (map_graph full pipeline):
  Tiny: 27.496 ms total latency
  Large: 27.496 ms total latency
  Ratio: 1.00× ❌ WRONG
```

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

**File:** `docs/bugs/efficiency_factor_not_visible.md` (comprehensive 500+ line RCA)

**Status:** 80% complete - Root cause narrowed down but final diagnosis pending

**What We Know:**
- ✅ Thermal operating points are configured correctly
- ✅ PerformanceCharacteristics have different values
- ✅ `_calculate_latency()` uses efficiency_factor correctly
- ✅ Memory-bound behavior is correct (both mappers identical for low AI)
- ❌ Compute-bound behavior is wrong (both mappers identical for high AI)

**Leading Theory:**
- SIMD/vectorization speedups in `map_subgraph()` are hardcoded
- These speedups are applied BEFORE `_calculate_latency()` is called
- The hardcoded factors might be masking the efficiency_factor differences
- OR latency aggregation in `map_graph()` is using a different code path

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete RCA)
1. Add debug logging to `map_subgraph()` to trace exact values
2. Verify thermal profile selection in production code path
3. Check if SIMD adjustments are preventing efficiency_factor from taking effect
4. Identify exact location where the 4.80× ratio is being neutralized

### Short-term (Fix)
1. Fix the integration issue so mapper variants produce different predictions
2. Run calibration sweep on large models to tune large mapper coefficients
3. Add integration tests to prevent regression
4. Document the expected behavior and validation criteria

### Long-term (Architecture)
1. Refactor performance modeling to make coefficient application explicit
2. Move SIMD efficiency into PerformanceCharacteristics (not hardcoded)
3. Create comprehensive validation suite for performance model
4. Add CI/CD checks that verify calibrated coefficients affect predictions

## Key Learnings

### 1. Terminology Matters
The "empirical_derate" name caused confusion because:
- "Derate by X%" linguistically means "reduce by X%"
- But the coefficient represents "fraction achieved" (efficiency)
- Renaming to "efficiency_factor" makes the meaning crystal clear

### 2. Unit Tests ≠ Integration Tests
- Unit test proves `_calculate_latency()` works correctly
- Integration test reveals full pipeline has issues
- Both are essential for catching different types of bugs

### 3. Performance Models Are Complex
Multiple speedup factors applied in different places:
- SIMD vectorization (map_subgraph)
- AMX/VNNI acceleration (map_subgraph)
- Threading overhead (map_subgraph)
- efficiency_factor (_calculate_latency)
- Memory bottleneck (_calculate_latency)

Understanding the interaction between these factors is non-trivial.

### 4. Memory-Bound vs Compute-Bound
For tiny models (AI < 1):
- Memory bandwidth dominates
- efficiency_factor doesn't matter (memory-bound)
- Both mappers correctly show identical latency

For large models (AI > 10):
- Compute throughput dominates
- efficiency_factor SHOULD matter (compute-bound)
- But current implementation shows identical latency (BUG)

## Recommendation

**Continue investigation** with debug logging to:
1. Identify where the 4.80× ratio is being lost
2. Fix the integration issue
3. Validate with empirical sweep on large models

**Then proceed** with production deployment of mapper variants.

**Status:** Investigation successful, fix pending.
