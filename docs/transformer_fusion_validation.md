## Implementation

### New Operation Types

Added transformer-specific operation types to `graph_structures.py`:

```python
# Transformer operations
MULTIHEAD_ATTENTION = "multihead_attention"
DROPOUT = "dropout"
STOCHASTIC_DEPTH = "stochastic_depth"  # Drop path
LAYERNORM = "layernorm"
```

### Fusible Patterns

Added transformer fusion patterns to `fusion_partitioner.py`:

```python
# Transformer patterns (ViT, Swin, BERT, etc.)
# Attention block
('LayerNorm', 'MultiheadAttention'),
('MultiheadAttention', 'Dropout'),
('Dropout', 'add'),  # Post-attention residual

# Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
('LayerNorm', 'Linear'),
('Linear', 'GELU'),  # FFN first layer
('GELU', 'Linear'),  # FFN second layer (after dropout)
('Linear', 'Dropout'),  # After FFN layers

# Stochastic depth (drop path) for transformers
('StochasticDepth', 'add'),
('stochastic_depth', 'add'),
```

## Fusion Pattern Analysis

### ViT Transformer Block Structure

A typical ViT transformer block consists of:

```
Input
  ↓
LayerNorm ──────────┐
  ↓                 │ FUSED (2 ops)
MultiheadAttention ─┘
  ↓
getitem (select output)
  ↓
Dropout
  ↓
add (residual) ← (connects to input)
  ↓
LayerNorm ────┐
  ↓           │
Linear ───────┤
  ↓           │ FUSED (4 ops)
GELU ─────────┤
  ↓           │
Dropout ──────┘
  ↓
Linear ────┐
  ↓        │ FUSED (2 ops)
Dropout ───┘
  ↓
add (residual) ← (connects to after first add)
  ↓
Output
```

### Detected Fusion Patterns

#### 1. Attention Block (2 ops)
```
LayerNorm → MultiheadAttention
```
- Count: 12 (one per transformer block)
- Memory Save: 5.7%
- Bottleneck: Bandwidth-bound
- **Why it matters**: Reduces kernel launches for attention computation

#### 2. FFN First Half (4 ops)
```
LayerNorm → Linear → GELU → Dropout
```
- Count: 12 (one per transformer block)
- Memory Save: 30.4% (excellent!)
- Bottleneck: Bandwidth-bound
- **Why it matters**: FFN first expansion reduces intermediate tensor materialization

#### 3. FFN Second Half (2 ops)
```
Linear → Dropout
```
- Count: 12 (one per transformer block)
- Memory Save: 4.6%
- Bottleneck: Bandwidth-bound
- **Why it matters**: Projection layer with regularization

### Comparison with CNN Fusion

| Metric | CNNs (EfficientNet) | Transformers (ViT) | Difference |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Fusion Efficiency** | 3.51× | 1.38× | CNNs 2.5× better |
| **Memory Reduction** | 46.4% | 13.6% | CNNs 3.4× better |
| **Avg AI** | 11.0 | 0.48 | CNNs 23× better |
| **Bottleneck** | 54% bandwidth | 99% bandwidth | Transformers worse |

**Why Transformers Have Lower Fusion**:
1. **Control Flow Operations**: Transformers have many getitem, reshape, permute operations that can't be fused
2. **Attention Complexity**: Multi-head attention involves many splits/concatenations
3. **Residual Connections**: Add operations create join points that limit fusion
4. **Lower Arithmetic Intensity**: More memory-bound operations

## Validation Criteria

### ✅ Criterion 1: Attention Block Fusion

**Requirement**: LayerNorm → MultiheadAttention should fuse

**Result**: ✅ PASS
- ViT-B/16: 12 instances detected
- Pattern correctly identified
- No false positives

**Conclusion**: Attention block fusion working correctly for standard transformers

### ✅ Criterion 2: FFN Fusion

**Requirement**: FFN layers should fuse as LayerNorm → Linear → GELU → Dropout

**Result**: ✅ PASS

- Swin-T: 12 instances (4 ops each)
- Pattern matches expected structure
- Memory savings: 30.4% (ViT), 43.2% (Swin)

**Conclusion**: FFN fusion provides substantial memory benefits

### ✅ Criterion 3: Cross-Architecture Support

**Requirement**: Patterns should work for both ViT and Swin

**Result**: ✅ PASS
- ViT: Uses standard MultiheadAttention
- Swin: Uses custom shifted_window_attention (not fused, but FFN works)
- Both show FFN fusion patterns

**Conclusion**: Fusion patterns generalize across transformer architectures

### ✅ Criterion 4: No False Fusion

**Requirement**: Should not fuse incompatible operations

**Result**: ✅ PASS
- Residual add operations left unfused (correct - join point)
- Control flow operations left unfused (correct - not compute)
- getitem/reshape operations left unfused (correct)

**Conclusion**: Fusion is conservative and correct

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Access Patterns

**ViT Transformer**:
- Total Memory Traffic: 507MB
- Unfused: 587MB
- Reduction: 13.6%

**Breakdown**:
- Attention: ~40% of memory traffic
- FFN: ~45% of memory traffic
- Control/Residual: ~15% of memory traffic

**Key Insight**: FFN fusion provides most of the memory savings (30.4%), while attention fusion provides less (5.7%) due to the complexity of multi-head attention.

### Arithmetic Intensity Analysis

**Transformers vs CNNs**:
```
EfficientNet Conv Block:  AI = 27.4 FLOPs/byte (compute-bound)
ViT Attention Block:      AI = 0.0 FLOPs/byte (bandwidth-bound)
ViT FFN Block:            AI = 0.4 FLOPs/byte (bandwidth-bound)
```

**Why Transformers Are Bandwidth-Bound**:
1. **Attention mechanism**: O(N²) memory for sequence length N
2. **Small matrices**: ViT patches are 16×16, creating many small operations
3. **Frequent reshapes**: Data layout changes reduce compute intensity
4. **Residual connections**: Skip connections add memory traffic

## Transformer-Specific Fusion Challenges

### 1. Control Flow Operations

**Issue**: Transformers have many non-compute operations:
- `getitem`: Extract outputs from MultiheadAttention (returns tuple)
- `reshape`/`permute`: Change tensor layouts for attention
- `expand`/`cat`: Manipulate class tokens and patches
- `eq`/`_assert`: Runtime shape validation

**Impact**: 76.9% single-op subgraphs (mostly control flow)

**Solution**: These operations are correctly left unfused - they don't benefit from fusion

### 2. Residual Connections

**Issue**: `add` operations for residuals are join points (2 inputs)

**Current Behavior**: Left unfused (conservative)

**Potential Improvement**: Could fuse `Dropout → add` if preceding operations are fused

**Expected Gain**: ~5-10% additional fusion coverage

### 3. Multi-Head Attention Complexity

**Issue**: MultiheadAttention internally splits Q, K, V into heads:
- Split into H heads
- Compute H attention matrices
- Concatenate H outputs

**Current Behavior**: Treated as single operation (correct)

**Alternative**: Could break down into QKV projections → split → attention → concat

**Trade-off**: More fusion opportunities vs increased complexity

## Fusion Pattern Effectiveness

### Memory Savings by Pattern

| Pattern | Memory Saved | Why? |
|---------|--------------|------|
| **FFN (4 ops)** | 30-43% | Eliminates 3 intermediate tensors (after LayerNorm, Linear, GELU) |
| **Linear+Dropout** | 4-9% | Eliminates 1 intermediate tensor |
| **LayerNorm+Attention** | 5-6% | Small - attention output still needed for residual |

**Key Insight**: FFN fusion is the most effective transformer pattern, providing 30-43% memory reduction.

### Kernel Launch Reduction

**ViT-B/16** (12 transformer blocks):
- Unfused: 216 kernel launches (computational ops only)
- Fused: 156 kernel launches
- Reduction: 60 fewer launches (27.8% reduction)

**Per-Block Analysis**:
- Attention: 2 ops → 1 fused (50% reduction)
- FFN: 6 ops → 2 fused (66.7% reduction)

## Comparison Across Architectures

| Architecture | Fusion Efficiency | Memory Reduction | Avg AI | Primary Bottleneck |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|--------|--------------------|
| **EfficientNet-B0** | 3.51× | 46.4% | 11.0 | Balanced (54% BW) |
| **ResNet-50** | 2.40× | 24.2% | 47.2 | Compute (49% CB) |
| **ViT-B/16** | 1.38× | 13.6% | 0.48 | Bandwidth (99% BW) |
| **Swin-T** | 1.42× | 18.1% | 0.19 | Bandwidth (99% BW) |

**Observations**:
1. CNNs benefit more from fusion (3-4× higher efficiency)
2. Transformers are more bandwidth-limited
3. FFN fusion in transformers is still valuable (30-43% memory save)

## Future Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Attention Fusion

**Current**: LayerNorm → MultiheadAttention (2 ops)

**Potential**: Break down MultiheadAttention:
```
LayerNorm → QKV_Projection → Split_Heads → Attention_Compute → Concat_Heads → Output_Projection
```

**Expected Gain**: 3-4× more fusion in attention blocks
**Complexity**: High - requires understanding MultiheadAttention internals

### 2. Residual Connection Fusion

**Current**: `Dropout → add` left unfused (join point)

**Potential**: Allow fusion if one input is from fused chain:
```
... → Dropout → add (with residual)
```

**Expected Gain**: 5-10% additional fusion coverage
**Complexity**: Medium - need special handling for joins

### 3. Stochastic Depth (Drop Path) Support

**Current**: StochasticDepth recognized but not extensively fused

**Potential**: Fuse drop path into FFN blocks:
```
... → Dropout → StochasticDepth → add
```

**Expected Gain**: 2-3% additional fusion
**Complexity**: Low - pattern already partially supported

### 4. Transformer Variant Support

**Candidates**:
- BERT-style models (text transformers)
- DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformers)
- BEiT (BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers)
- CrossViT (Cross-Attention Multi-Scale Vision Transformer)

**Expected**: Similar fusion patterns with some architecture-specific variations
