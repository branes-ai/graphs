"""
Validation package for DNN characterization tests.

This package contains validation scripts for testing the characterization
pipeline against known models and theoretical values.

Validation Scripts:
- test_conv2d.py: Validates Conv2D stack characterization
- test_resnet18.py: Deep analysis of ResNet-18
- test_resnet_family.py: Comparison of ResNet-18/34/50

Usage:
    python -m graphs.validation.test_conv2d
    python -m graphs.validation.test_resnet18
    python -m graphs.validation.test_resnet_family
