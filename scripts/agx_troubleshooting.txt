#  Troubleshooting checklist:

1. What power mode is set?
  sudo nvpmodel -q

  # 2. What are the actual GPU clock limits in this mode?
  cat /sys/devices/17000000.ga10b/devfreq/17000000.ga10b/max_freq
  cat /sys/devices/17000000.ga10b/devfreq/17000000.ga10b/min_freq
  cat /sys/devices/17000000.ga10b/devfreq/17000000.ga10b/cur_freq

  # 3. Force max clocks to see if it's a DVFS issue
  sudo jetson_clocks
  # Then re-check:
  cat /sys/devices/17000000.ga10b/devfreq/17000000.ga10b/cur_freq

  # 4. What modes are available?
  sudo nvpmodel -p --verbose

  # 5. Try MAXN mode
  sudo nvpmodel -m 0
  sudo jetson_clocks

  After setting MAXN + jetson_clocks, re-run:
  cli/calibrate_hardware.py --id jetson_orin_agx_gpu --framework pytorch

  The core issue is likely that MODE_30W on this AGX board caps the GPU at 612 MHz max, and without jetson_clocks the DVFS governor keeps it at idle
  (306 MHz) because our benchmarks are too bursty for the governor to ramp up in time. The Nano/NX numbers at 918 MHz MAXN are with clocks fully
  boosted.
