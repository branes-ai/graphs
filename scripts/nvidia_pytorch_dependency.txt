To avoid that faith you need to install the NVIDIA wheel first, then the rest of requirements without torch:

  source .venv/bin/activate

# 1. Install NVIDIA's CUDA-enabled PyTorch first
  pip install --no-cache-dir
  https://developer.download.nvidia.cn/compute/redist/jp/v512/pytorch/torch-2.1.0a0+41361538.nv23.06-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl

# 2. Install remaining requirements, skipping torch since it's already installed
  pip install -r requirements.txt

pip won't overwrite the already-installed torch with the PyPI version since it satisfies the requirement. Verify after:
