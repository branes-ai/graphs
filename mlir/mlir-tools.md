You have several good options for experimenting with and executing MLIR code like the Linalg example I provided:

1. **MLIR Interactive Shell:**  The simplest way to get started is with the MLIR interactive shell (`mlir-shell`).  This lets you type in MLIR code and see the results immediately.  It's excellent for learning and experimenting.  You'll need to have the LLVM/MLIR build environment set up (see below).

2. **`mlir-opt`:** This is a command-line tool that's part of the LLVM/MLIR distribution.  It's very powerful for transforming and optimizing MLIR. You can use it to parse, print, verify, and apply passes to your MLIR code.  It's a good choice for scripting and more advanced use cases.  You can use it to convert the Linalg to LLVM IR and then compile to machine code.

3. **Compiler Explorer (Godbolt):** Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org) is a fantastic online tool.  While it's primarily known for showing assembly code, it also has support for MLIR.  You can paste your MLIR code in and see the output of various transformations and even compile it.  This is a great option if you don't want to set up a local environment.  However, it might not support all MLIR dialects or features.

4. **Building LLVM/MLIR Locally:**  For the most comprehensive experience and to have access to all the tools, you'll want to build LLVM/MLIR from source.  This can be a bit involved, but it's the best way to get the latest features and have full control.  The LLVM website has excellent instructions for building.

5. **Docker Images:**  There are Docker images available that have LLVM/MLIR pre-installed.  This can simplify the setup process.  Search Docker Hub for "llvm" or "mlir" to find suitable images.

**Recommended Approach for Beginners:**

For beginners, I recommend starting with the MLIR interactive shell (`mlir-shell`) or Compiler Explorer.  `mlir-shell` is particularly good for interacting with the MLIR code step by step. If you're comfortable with command-line tools, `mlir-opt` is very powerful.

**Steps to use `mlir-opt` (after building LLVM/MLIR):**

1. **Save the MLIR code:** Save the Linalg code I provided in a file, for example, `mlp.mlir`.

2. **Use `mlir-opt` to verify:**
   ```bash
   mlir-opt -verify mlp.mlir
   ```
   This will check if the MLIR is well-formed.

3. **Use `mlir-opt` to convert to LLVM IR (and then to object file or executable):** You'll need a series of passes to lower the Linalg dialect to LLVM IR.  There's no single command to do this automatically, and it depends on your target.  A typical (simplified) sequence might look something like this (but could need more passes):

   ```bash
   mlir-opt mlp.mlir -linalg-to-loops -convert-linalg-to-std -std-to-llvm | \
   mlir-opt -convert-llvm-to-llvm-ir | \
   llc -filetype=obj -o mlp.o -
   ```

   Then you would link the object file with any necessary libraries to create an executable.  This last step is highly target-dependent.

   (A more robust and target-specific lowering sequence will likely be more involved and require more passes.)

**Important Note about Softmax:**  The simplified softmax I provided is just for demonstration.  A proper softmax is significantly more complex to implement efficiently in Linalg.  For real applications, you'll likely want to use a more optimized approach or a higher-level framework that handles softmax efficiently.  You might even consider writing a custom operation for softmax and registering it with MLIR.


You're right to ask!  `mlir-shell` isn't built directly as a separate executable. It's an interactive mode within the `mlir-opt` tool.  So, you build `mlir-opt`, and then you can use it to enter the interactive shell.

Here's how you build `mlir-opt` (and thus get access to `mlir-shell`):

1. **Set up your build environment:** You'll need the standard tools for building C++ projects: a C++ compiler (like Clang or GCC), CMake, and Ninja (or Make).

2. **Clone the LLVM repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
   cd llvm-project
   ```

3. **Create a build directory:** It's good practice to build in a separate directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

4. **Configure the build with CMake:**  This is the crucial step.  You need to tell CMake to build the MLIR tools, including `mlir-opt`.  Here's a typical CMake configuration (you might need to adjust paths depending on your system):

   ```bash
   cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir;clang" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../llvm
   ```
   * `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir;clang"`: This is *essential*.  It tells CMake to build the MLIR project (and Clang, which is often needed for MLIR development). If you want to build more projects you can separate them with semicolons, e.g. `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir;clang;lld"`.
   * `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`: Builds with optimizations.  Use `Debug` if you want to debug.
   * `../llvm`:  Specifies the path to the LLVM source directory.

5. **Build with Ninja (recommended) or Make:**
   ```bash
   ninja
   # Or, if you prefer Make:
   make -j<number_of_cores>  # Use -j for parallel builds
   ```
   This step will take a while, especially the first time.

6. **Find `mlir-opt`:**  After the build completes, `mlir-opt` (and many other MLIR tools) will be in the `build/bin` directory.

7. **Run `mlir-shell`:** Now you can run the interactive shell:
   ```bash
   ./bin/mlir-opt -interactive
   ```
   (Make sure you're in the `build` directory, or provide the full path to `mlir-opt`.)

**Important Notes:**

* **Build Time:** Building LLVM/MLIR can take a significant amount of time (often several hours). Be prepared for this.
* **Disk Space:** The build process will also consume a lot of disk space (tens of gigabytes).
* **Dependencies:** Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed (like Python, CMake, etc.). The LLVM documentation has a good list of required tools.
* **CMake Options:**  There are many CMake options you can use to customize the build.  Refer to the LLVM documentation for a complete list.

**Simplified Build with Docker (Alternative):**

If you're having trouble with the local build, consider using a Docker image.  This can greatly simplify the process.  Search Docker Hub for "llvm" or "mlir" to find pre-built images.  However, using Docker might add a layer of complexity if you're not already familiar with it.

By following these steps, you should be able to build `mlir-opt` and then use it to access the `mlir-shell`.  Let me know if you run into any specific errors during the build process, and I'll do my best to help!
