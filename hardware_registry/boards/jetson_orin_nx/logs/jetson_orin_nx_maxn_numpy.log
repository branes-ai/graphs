Calibration file: /home/lanner/dev/branes/clones/graphs/hardware_registry/cpu/jetson_orin_nx_16gb_cpu/calibrations/schedutil_1190MHz_numpy.json

Next steps:
  1. Review the calibration results above
  2. View calibration efficiency:
     ./cli/show_calibration_efficiency.py --id jetson_orin_nx_16gb_cpu

  3. Use in analysis (calibration auto-loaded from registry):
     ./cli/analyze_comprehensive.py --model resnet18 --hardware jetson_orin_nx_16gb_cpu
