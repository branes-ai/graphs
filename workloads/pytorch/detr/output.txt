Caching files will still work but in a degraded version that might require more space on your disk. This warning can be disabled by setting the `HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING` environment variable. For more details, see https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/how-to-cache#limitations.
To support symlinks on Windows, you either need to activate Developer Mode or to run Python as an administrator. In order to activate developer mode, see this article: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development
