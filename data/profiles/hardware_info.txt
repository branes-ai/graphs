# Chip Structure: 
#   A single TPU v4 chip typically contains two TensorCores, which Google refers to 
#   as a "megacore" configuration that share a unified 32 GB HBM memory space.
# 
# TPU v4i: 
#   A specific inference variant, the TPU v4i, is a single-core chip (half the compute 
#   of the full TPU v4) designed for air cooling and optimized for inference workloads. 
#   Its peak performance is roughly half the dual-core TPU v4.
# 
# Scalability: 
#   TPUs are designed to scale massively using a custom, high-speed optical interconnect, 
#   which allows a single TPU v4 Pod of 4,096 chips to achieve an aggregate compute of 1.1 ExaFLOPS.


# KPUs are very scalable, so there are many different profiles possible.
# The nomenclature is T###, representing the available TOPS capability of the SoC
