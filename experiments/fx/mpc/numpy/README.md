# **Example MPC Implementation**

The enhanced code now includes:

1. **Full Closed-Loop MPC Controller** that drives the plant to zero error over multiple time steps
2. **Realistic Chemical Reactor Model** with proper dynamics, delays, and disturbances
3. **Complete Simulation Loop** that handles setpoint changes and demonstrates convergence

## **Computational Graph Analysis**

Both approaches now capture the **complete algorithm**:

### **TorchScript Analysis:**
- Captures the entire closed-loop simulation (30+ time steps)
- Shows optimization opportunities in the control loop
- Provides performance metrics and deployment-ready format
- Better for production C++ integration

### **FX Analysis (Recommended for Modern Development):**
- More detailed node-by-node introspection
- Better debugging and development experience
- Shows exact operation sequence and data flow
- Easier to modify and optimize

## **Key Insights for C++ Development**

When interacting with modern C++, the main takeaways are:

1. **FX is the modern choice** - actively developed, better tooling, more flexible
2. **Graph analysis reveals vectorization opportunities** - many MPC operations can be parallelized
3. **Hybrid approach works well** - use Python for prototyping, C++ for performance-critical parts
4. **libtorch integration** - seamless way to use PyTorch models in C++ applications

The computational graphs now show a realistic control system with:
- **Feedback loops** (current temperature → error → control → plant → new temperature)
- **Memory elements** (integral term accumulation, control history)
- **Constraint handling** (control limits, rate limits)
- **Dynamic behavior** (setpoint changes, disturbance rejection)

The MPC controller demonstrates the closed-loop behavior of real-time control system.
This gives you a much more meaningful graph to analyze and optimize for your C++ implementation.
